## Usage

Here's a simple example of how to use the Couchbase Capella provider in your Terraform configuration.

```hcl
provider "couchbase" {
  username = var.couchbase_username
  password = var.couchbase_password
}

resource "couchbase_cluster" "example" {
  name     = "example-cluster"
  region   = "us-west"
  plan     = "development"
  version  = "7.0"
}
```

## Configuration

### Provider Configuration

You need to configure the provider with your Couchbase Capella credentials. Create a `variables.tf` file to define the required variables:

```hcl
variable "couchbase_username" {
  description = "Couchbase Capella username"
  type        = string
}

variable "couchbase_password" {
  description = "Couchbase Capella password"
  type        = string
}
```

### Resource Configuration

You can define multiple resources in your configuration. Here are some examples:

#### Cluster Resource

```hcl
resource "couchbase_cluster" "my_cluster" {
  name     = "my-cluster"
  region   = "us-east"
  plan     = "production"
  version  = "7.0"
}
```

#### Bucket Resource

```hcl
resource "couchbase_bucket" "my_bucket" {
  name     = "my-bucket"
  cluster  = couchbase_cluster.my_cluster.name
  ram_quota = 256
}
```

## Resources

### Available Resources

- `couchbase_cluster`: Manage Couchbase clusters.
- `couchbase_bucket`: Manage Couchbase buckets.
- `couchbase_scope`: Manage scopes within a bucket.
- `couchbase_collection`: Manage collections within a scope.

### Data Sources

- `couchbase_clusters`: Retrieve information about existing Couchbase clusters.
- `couchbase_buckets`: Retrieve information about existing Couchbase buckets.

## Examples

For more detailed examples, check the `examples` directory in this repository. Here are a few examples to get you started:

### Basic Example

A basic example of setting up a Couchbase cluster and bucket:

```hcl
provider "couchbase" {
  username = var.couchbase_username
  password = var.couchbase_password
}

resource "couchbase_cluster" "example" {
  name     = "example-cluster"
  region   = "us-west"
  plan     = "development"
  version  = "7.0"
}

resource "couchbase_bucket" "example_bucket" {
  name      = "example-bucket"
  cluster   = couchbase_cluster.example.name
  ram_quota = 256
}
```

### Advanced Example

An advanced example with scopes and collections:

```hcl
provider "couchbase" {
  username = var.couchbase_username
  password = var.couchbase_password
}

resource "couchbase_cluster" "advanced_example" {
  name     = "advanced-cluster"
  region   = "us-east"
  plan     = "production"
  version  = "7.0"
}

resource "couchbase_bucket" "advanced_bucket" {
  name      = "advanced-bucket"
  cluster   = couchbase_cluster.advanced_example.name
  ram_quota = 512
}

resource "couchbase_scope" "my_scope" {
  bucket = couchbase_bucket.advanced_bucket.name
  name   = "my_scope"
}

resource "couchbase_collection" "my_collection" {
  scope   = couchbase_scope.my_scope.name
  bucket  = couchbase_bucket.advanced_bucket.name
  name    = "my_collection"
}
```
